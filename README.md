This HW was to determine citibike trends in NJ.
First- I downloaded data by month and used pandas to join all 12 documents into 1 csv.
2nd to formulate a story, I found different locatins where citibikes are most popular, demographics and most popular bikes via different sheets.
A dashboard was created with populated sheets
A story was created to tell as story using data visualization.
